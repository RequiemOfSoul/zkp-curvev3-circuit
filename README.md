# zkp-curvev3-circuit
Rewrite **Curve V3** using *Rust* and *Plonk Circuit*.
## Overview
[Curve](https://www.curve.fi/) is an exchange liquidity pool on Ethereum designed for extremely efficient stablecoin trading and low risk, supplemental fee income for liquidity providers, without an opportunity cost.
To implement layer2's Curve algorithm, I need to implement the Rust and Circuit versions of the Curve.
